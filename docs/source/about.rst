JUNCTION BOX
------------

What's in a name?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|
The process of writing software is very similar to the electrical trade in the sense that things are wired up or connected.

Hence the name **Junction Box**, a place where things are connected.

|
Overview
---------

|
This project is about documenting how we use several technologies that meet the needs of our software development initiatives.

|
What
-----

|
To kick-off, we will be exploring and documenting these technologies:

#. `Diátaxis <https://diataxis.fr/>`__:  A documentation content organisation framework.
#. `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__:  A document building tool.

|
When how we use the first two items has been  documented, other technologies on our list include:

|
#. `Continuous Delivery <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCfqyGl3nq_V0bo64CjZh8g>`__: Dave Farley Style.
#. `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__: A python web framework.
#. `Pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/>`__: A software testing tool.
#. `Hypothesis <https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__: A software testing tool.
#. `Playwright <https://playwright.dev/>`__: End-to-end testing for modern web apps

|
How
---
|
#. Create and follow a style guide.
#. Create standard layouts for content.
#. Follow the  Diátaxis document content framework.
#. Only record what we have used and tested.

|
Why
----

|
Documentation is a critical task often overlooked or poorly executed.

Over time as memories fade or moved on to other tasks, good quality project or business documentation becomes evident.

Often things that make sense now, while our brain is working in that context, don't make sense later.

Good documentation can reduce the load when it is needed.

*This may help some one else!*

|
When
------
|
Following Continuous Delivery Principles, this is a living document.

The Author
----------
|
Mark Sevelj has an electrical trade background.

Roles where often technical and using Python and pandas for data analysis was a lot faster than excel.

A need to formalise and document these scripts and workflows is now the purpose of this endeavour.
