============
reST Toctree
============

:sep:`..toctree::` inserts a Table of Contents (TOC) at the current
location.

reST can not interconnect several documents or split documents into multiple
output files.

Sphinx uses a *custom directive* :sep:`..toctree::`,  to add links between
the documentation files and table of contents.
