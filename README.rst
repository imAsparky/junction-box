A junction box is a place for making connections.
-------------------------------------------------
|

*Here, we document connections between technologies for our software development framework.*

|

Would you mind providing feedback or creating a discussion on our GitHub
`discussion board <https://github.com/imAsparky/junction-box/discussions>`__?

Junction Box documentation `here <https://junction-box.readthedocs.io/>`__.

Technologies
------------

Here is the list of our chosen technologies where documentation is under active
development and will be available when complete.

#. `Traefik <https://traefik.io/>`__ Cloud-Native networking stack that just works.

#. `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__ Accelerate how you build, share, and
    run modern applications.

#. `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__` makes it easier to build better
   web apps more quickly and with less code.

|

Documentation
-------------

* `Diátaxis <https://diataxis.fr/>`__ is the documentation framework employed.
  Diátaxis adopts a systematic approach to structuring technical documentation.

      See an excellent presentation at `Pycon Melbourne 2017
      <https://youtu.be/t4vKPhjcMZg>`__  by the creator of Diátaxis
      Daniele Procida.

|

* `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__, created for the Python
  language, provides excellent facilities for documenting projects using
  various languages.  This project uses
  `reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`__.

|

* `Templates
  <https://junction-box.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Document-Templates/template-index.html>`__
  have been added to get documentation up and running fast.  More templates are
  under development.

* `Semantic Versioning`  has been added. See the
  `CHANGELOG <https://junction-box.readthedocs.io/en/stable/CHANGELOG.html>`__
  for all the latest updates.
